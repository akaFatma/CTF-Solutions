#category : cryptography 

A CSR file, which stands for Certificate Signing Request
is a file generated by an entity  when it wants to apply for a digital certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA)

When an individual or an entity wants to protect their
website , they generate a CSR file ; it contains  information such as the organization's name, domain name, locality, and public key.

The CSR file itself is a plaintext that is encoded , i found a tool online called  at https://www.sslchecker.com/csr/decode

the decrypted file is as follows :


signature : valid
key size : 2048
